By now the incriminating footage will not have only been discovered and released but uploaded in myriad ways for the public forum and courthouse that is the internet, blogged about and butchered by a thousand writers and expounded upon and examined by experts professional and amateur, online and offline. Soon all aspects of my life will be laid bare before the world. Anyone with whom I even shook hands will become a witness whose words will fuel multiple tales, multiple careers, maybe even a movie or two. I’ll be the talk of the town, nay the world. My name will be uttered with fear and perhaps even envy.
 
I heard them break through the door—most likely well-meaning intrepid agents of some government, maybe my own, come to take me into protective custody (or whatever they call it these days). Of course, all that effort will all be for naught. They will never catch me. They can never catch me. They’ll have better luck finding Jimmy Hoffa drinking with DB Cooper at a bar run by the esteemed Judge Crater and owned by Ambrose Bierce. But I digress.
 
Before I am forced to flee my home and perhaps spend the remainder of my days in lonely exile, forever alone in the crowd, I am going to write this little chronicle and do my best to diffuse it online and offline.  If I am going to become legend, detached from mortal comprehension and, worse, mortal sympathy, I might as well have a say in how that legend is crafted. Furthermore, this little history will shed some light on some unfortunate events, which, to my everlasting regret, might have caused much pain to numerous individuals, who deserve to be no longer kept in the dark (even those who I feel deserved it).
 
I lament that I have never been much of a writer (a USB drive worth of half-started novels and an anthology’s worth of unfinished short stories will stand as a legion of silent witnesses to my narrative skill), and I have always found beginning to write to be rather hard. If all else falls, in media res, I suppose. Thus, I’ll start by explaining my role in a recent episode that has already engendered the most curiosity and which will undoubtedly serve to showcase the full extent of my power and its concomitant burden. I am, of course, referring to the final flight of Oceanic Air 729 and the miraculous survival of all passengers and crew (well most of them) despite the total destruction of the plane.
 
The plane had been in a downward spiral toward the unyielding sea. The nose of the plane was a few hundred meters from breaching the citadel of Poseidon and carrying its passengers and crew to the realm of Hades. Black smoke billowed out from the starboard engine, serving as an exclamation point to this modern take on the tale of Icarus. The passengers and crew were on the edge of oblivion, their arms raised high, as if they were melodramatically throwing themselves at the feet of the Grim Reaper and beseeching him for a reprieve that would never come. Most like me had lost consciousness due to the speed at which the plane had been making its unplanned descent.
 
However, although I, like my fellow passengers, faded into black at some point during the plane’s unanticipated sudden descent toward the hard embrace of the unforgiving water, I regained consciousness a few seconds before the potentially fatal moment—last minute self-preservation perhaps. My body ached from where the seatbelt had been restraining my falling body. I was lucky if I escaped unscathed with only a few bruises and nothing worse. I could still move despite my dolorous condition and walk about the plane.

For five days, the plane had been frozen in its descent. For five days, the people on board remained a half-minute from certain death. For five days, I was alone in the company of people stuck in another time frame. For five days, I had been holding back eternity.
 
For you see, I have the ability to stop time for all but myself. Or better put, I can exist in another time, my own separate time, different from yours.
 
For five days, I had been wandering (or stumbling rather given the plane’s orientation relative to the ocean) about the cabin and taking stock of the situation. I had helped myself to the victuals and viands available on the plane, even some of their more luxurious items usually out of my price range (I hope I do not receive a bill from Oceanic Air for this). After I had recovered from the initial shock of realizing how close I had come to departing for that undiscovered country that awaits us all and become accustomed to ghastly sight around me (the copious amounts of fine cheeses and chocolates pilfered from first class were quite effective anodynes), I found myself baffled. Before I would had to have halted time consciously, but there I was, still alive, safe in my own separate time frame.
 
Of course, you will ask me how does it feel to separate yourself from time or to stop time? How do you know? Is it like flexing a muscle or grinding your teeth? Is it exhausting? Explaining how it feels and how I know that I’ve cut myself off from regular time puts me in a rather difficult epistemological situation. It can only be explained through feeble approximations, analogies and metaphors, just as you or I could never explain to any degree of a satisfaction to a blind man the way the color blue looks or to explain to a lifelong vegetarian the taste of a juicy cut of sirloin. The best way I could conceive of describing how it feels to stop time is that it’s like putting an object on the shelf or taking off one’s shoes. I know my shoes are off and they are off until I put them on again.
 
I do not feel any physical strain from halting time. However, time is relative, doubly so when one can halt time. It can be incredibly disorienting to remain divorced from normal time. I need to iterate and reiterate how much time has passed for me or else it becomes incredibly disorienting. Of course, exacerbating my timekeeping problem is that having been a student for many years has habituated me to irregular hours and “long” days. It is fitting that living in my own personal time is marked by something incredibly personal, human. When there is no day or night and since clocks generally do not work for me, I keep track of when I fall asleep, when I can no longer hold my eyes open. This is still a problematic way of measuring time because the lack of external stimuli indicating the passage of time can be incredibly disorienting (I suppose it’s similar to those who live in countries that have days of the year where it’s all sunny or all dark). For instance, I had spent the equivalent of four days outside of normal time but thought only two days had passed). Thus, I generally try to avoid remaining outside of normal time for too long I fear it would drive me mad. Worse, if years passed for me but not for others, how could I explain the discrepancy in aging?  Or what would happen if I fell into a coma or got myself in a jam? Would the world forever be stopped, frozen forever at the moment of my demise?
 
Furthermore, although it has never happened and although I dread if it should ever occur (especially so in the days in which I shall describe below), I’ve yet to unconsciously slip in and out of my own separate time when I sleep (early when I first discovered that I had this ability, I had run a few informal experiments and subsequently discovered this)
 
So I can only say that five sleep cycles had passed since I awoke aboard the doomed plane. It could have been a week, given the trauma I had suffered. For five “days”, I had pondered what to do. What could I do? I had no idea where we were. I had only been half-paying attention to the flight information in between browsing entertainment options. I recalled that we were somewhere above the Pacific, maybe near California or one of the West Coast states.
 
Furthermore, now with some semblance of a sober mind and even become settled amid the souls in limbo (I had even made a suitably comfortable makeshift bed in first class after displacing a world famous chef from his perch, which I might add took some effort given his girth and weight), I realized that vital supplies were limited. I could search the luggage compartment and surely on such a large plane there would be some food and snacks brought from home for somebody’s Aunt so-and-so in the states. However, I’m not an aircraft designer and wouldn’t know how to access it. It’s hard saving the day, let alone your own bacon, when you know so little.
 
Again, if I remained in the plane, I would certainly run out food and liquid (oddly enough in my own time I can “drink” liquid in close contact with me, though it feels decidedly strange, unnatural for reasons I still cannot fathom). I certainly did not want to re-enter into normal time and die in a plane crash nor spend my remaining days languishing in a plane (or worse, if driven mad by hunger and temporal disorientation, resorting to cannibalism).
 
Gazing outside the window I knew we were near enough to the water that perhaps I could safely make the descent and bring myself to safety. Of course, if I got out of the plane and brought myself to the relative safety of the Pacific Ocean and then rejoined normal time, I would be alone and be waiting for some time for a rescue, or rather a salvage effort. Misery loves company. Plus, among the passengers, there might be someone with halfway decent survival training.
 
So it was on the sixth day that I elected to save everyone or nearly everyone. There was first the problem of opening the door and then getting out of the plane in the first place.
 
I began rifling through the luggage available in the overhead compartment in the hopes of something that would assist my descent (I confess that my wallet after the flight was a bit heavier than I would care to admit; being a poor graduate student can sometimes have an effect on one’s honesty) 

How far did I have to move everyone so they would survive? It was a rather large plane, and I guessed there must have been a few hundred people.
 
Could I feasibly move everyone? I already had enough difficulty moving the rather corpulent gourmet two seats over.
 

 
Fragments:
It began midway through my first round of college, the heady carefree of undergraduate…
 
The stern professor had begun to announce, with a hint of subdued sadistic glee, the dwindling minutes allowed to the condemned. I had wanted there to be more time.
 
Then I realized that the clock had stopped moving.
 
For the End of the book
 
And so now you know why they can never get me. And so now you know that I could be next to you now as you read this (or maybe just in your house re-arranging the books on your shelf and stealing one sock from all the pairs of socks you own for what the young folk call “shits and giggles”)—same universe, different times. And so if you find that a disagreeable politician was found with standing naked in the middle of Times Square, you shall know how it came to pass. And so if some bank finds its vault a bit short, you’ll know why (no worries I never take more than I need and they have insurance for it).  
 
Footnote:
I am at the library now, typing this manuscript up….
 
I saw someone or something move, in the distance, a shadow moved. I am not alone in this time. I am not alone, and now I am frightened.
